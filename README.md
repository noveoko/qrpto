# Qrpto

Quantum Resistant Protocol for Transmitting Orders (QRPTO)

An application to diseminate information to public forums (Reddit, Twitter, Pastebin, Facebook etc.) after the following:
* time elapsed (2 hours)
* specific time (October 3rd 2022 01:05:02:22)
* specific event (death of account owner confirmed by government entity)

The main benefit of this application is to provide anyone on Earth with access to a mobile device the ability to pass on important/critical information or insights to the general public if/when an event occurs without relying on third parties to diseminate such information.

## Call for Beta users

If you'd like to be one of the first beta users of this application please reach out to me.

## Tech Stack

The core application will first be developed using Python to determine the feasibility. If such a study confirms that the application has potential it will be developed using Flutter/Dash and be made available on multiple platforms.
